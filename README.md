## Introduction

Speaking Assistant is an intelligent message assistance tool, similar to a "super input method."
It predicts and completes text based on your past messages, making frequent replies faster and more natural.

No changes to your existing habits are required. It works on all websites, supports all languages, and is compatible with all input methods—ready to use immediately after installation.

All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is sent to or processed by any server, completely eliminating privacy leakage risks.
